On 25 March 2016 Ludo Renders, founder and chairman of the non-profit organization, passed away. Because of his contacts with the African community and development cooperation, Ludo was the passionate leader of “Boulevard Amandla,” an intercultural arts forum organized almost annually by La Piscine d'Activité vzw. It focused on the exchange and cross-fertilization between contemporary African art and contemporary European art. The various editions of the arts festival mainly took place in the vicinity of the De Coninckplein in Antwerp. Starting from the African character of this neighborhood, La Piscine d’Activité vzw communicated between the two continents to stimulate development in both directions.



Their generous donation of books and artworks helps us to work towards our goal of creating a Black community-driven and controlled archive that will share and collect documentary, audiovisual, digital, material and artistic works related to the Black diaspora in Belgium. This includes historical publications, contemporary documents, personal documents, and rare material produced by people of African descent - including scientists, professionals, community groups, activists, artists and other individuals. In addition to collecting, this initiative also aims to promote the use and research of collections through scientific resources, exhibitions, community outreach, student programs, and public engagement.



Collecting these materials enhances documentation of the current history of Black people in Belgium, and provides future access to the words, thoughts, and actions of many individuals and organizations in the late 20th century and beyond.



Donations such as these truly make the difference for us, and we are extremely grateful!
