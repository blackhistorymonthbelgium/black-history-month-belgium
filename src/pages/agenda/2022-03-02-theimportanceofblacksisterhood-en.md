In this growing individualistic world and the recent and current crisisses the importance of solidarity has only increased. We are all very familiar with the feeling of walking in a space and recognizing a fellow Black sister and experiencing the sense of relief. 

On this International Womenâ€™s Rights Day we will take the opportunity to reflect and discuss the essence for a Black sisterhood, what it means, what is the need and what are the mental health benefits of such a sisterhood. These however, are just a few of the questions that will be tackled during this interactive conversation facilitated by psychologist Brenda Anyango. 

It will be a night for sharing our experiences, joys, pains and journeys as Black self-identifying women and what it means to stand together.
