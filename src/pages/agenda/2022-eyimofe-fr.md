Eyimofe (This Is My Desire) - Arie & Chuko Esiri, 2020 - Nigeria - 116 min.
Tragedy and fate intervene as two Nigerians try to better the lives of their families. Eyimofe (This is My Desire) is a film about two people’s quest for what they believe will be a better life on foreign shores. After Mofe loses his family and Rosa fails to deliver on a promise, their travel plans collapse forcing them to reconsider living abroad. As time passes and wounds heal, they learn the future they desperately seek can be built at home.

Egúngún (Masquerade) - Olive Nwosu, 2021 - Nigeria - 14 min.
In search of healing, a young woman returns home, to Nigeria, the country of her birth.

After-Talk (online) with director Arie Esiri, moderated by Rachael Moore on Friday March 17th at 7PM/19:00.


Born in Lagos, Nigeria, Olive Nwosu is a BAFTA Pigott 2020 Scholar, Alex Sichel Fellow at Columbia University School of the Arts, and one of four ‘African Promises’ directors selected by the Institut Français. Olive has written and directed two award-winning short films. Troublemaker (2019), set in eastern Nigeria and featuring entirely non-actors, played in over 20 film festivals worldwide. The film received a 2020 National Board of Review Student Award, was nominated for ‘Best Short Film’ at Raindance, and toured France as a collection of African films curated by Clermont Ferrand International Film Festival. The film is distributed by Dedza Films and Kino Lorber and is now streaming on the Criterion Channel. Olive’s second film, Egúngún (Masquerade) (2021) was commissioned by the British Council and British Film Institute for their MoreFilms4Freedom programme. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, was nominated for ‘Best British Short Film’ by BIFA, won the ‘Best Short Film’ Award at the Hamptons International Film Festival and was selected at Sundance. It is represented by Ouat Media.
Arie and Chuko Esiri were born 30 minutes apart in Warri, Nigeria. Growing up in Lagos their mother would put a padlock on the TV in a misguided attempt to make them more studious. 20 years later both would enroll at film school. Arie graduated from Columbia University and Chuko NYU. During their time in New York they collaborated on a pair of short films: Besida (2018) which premiered at the 68th Berlinale, and Goose (2017), at the LA Film Festival. Eyimofe (2020) is their first feature film.
