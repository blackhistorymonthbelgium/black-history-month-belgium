The rich and growing body of black feminist writings of the last decades constitutes a powerful reminder of the fact that Black women have long worked to challenge and dismantle the many axes of oppression such as race, gender, class and ableism. Despite being widely excluded from mainstream feminism, history shows us that Black women have successfully harnessed the power of their nuanced experiences and knowledge to advocate for women’s rights.

Black feminism moves the voices and experiences Black women from the margins to the center of gender equality movements. In doing so, it engages with the multifaceted aspect of identity and gives way to the emergence of new forms of critical thinking, solidarity as well as solutions to fight systemic oppression.

Building on the mapping research work of Graciela Dutrieue, Black History Month Belgium will be holding an Open Forum to discuss and reflect on the past, present and future of Black feminist thought but also further exchange on the issues which continue to affect Black(-descendant) Women and non-binary People in Belgium.

Rachael Moore (she/her) is a British-born LGBT activist who lives and works in Brussels, Belgium. With a background in youth empowerment, LGBT rights, and advocacy, Rachael is no stranger to discrimination in social and professional settings. Previously she worked at the European Parliament and as the director of Rainbowhouse Brussels. Her experience at both local and European levels of politics has given her a greater insight into places that were never meant for Black people or people of colour. Together with Eric Cyuzuzo, she co-founded Rainbow Nation Brussels, an organization that pushes for a different narrative regarding the visibility of QTIBPOC through pushing for diversity, inclusivity, and multiculturalism that is not defined by whiteness, with a true ‘Nothing about Us without Us’ stance with regards to how the LGBT community deals with its own issues of racism, transphobia, and xenophobia. Rainbow Nation Brussels also provides support group meetings for QTIBPOC and organizes community-building activities for victims of racism. Rachael is also cofounded SHAKEDOWN Bxl which organizes cultural events that centralize queer and trans women and femme persons. Additionally, Rachael works as a consultant about intersectionality and anti-racism.
