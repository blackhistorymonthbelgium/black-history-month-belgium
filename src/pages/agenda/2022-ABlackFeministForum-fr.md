The rich and growing body of Black feminist writings of the last decades constitutes a powerful reminder of the fact that Black women, and the non-binary people that the world percieves and treats as such, have long worked to challenge and dismantle the many axes of oppression such as race, gender, class and disability. Despite being widely excluded from mainstream feminism, history shows us that Black women, and the non-binary people that the world percieves and treats as such, have successfully harnessed the power of their nuanced experiences and knowledge to advance and protect women’s rights.

 

Black feminism moves the voices and experiences of Black women, and the non-binary people that the world percieves and treats as such, from the margins to the center of equality movements, including within the arts and culture. In doing so, it engages with the multifaceted aspect of identity and gives way to the emergence of new forms of critical thinking, solidarity as well as empowering strategies to fight systemic oppression.

 

Building on the mapping research work of Graciela Dutrieue, Black History Month Belgium will be holding an Open Forum at the Kaaistudio's to discuss and reflect on the past, present and future of Black feminist thought but also further exchange on the issues which continue to affect Black(-descendant) Women and non-binary People in Belgium. After a keynote lecture by Dutrieue, and a special intervention by Ruth Grâce Paluku-Atoka, there will be a panel discussion with Philsan Osman, Aïda Yancy, Henriette Essami and Collectif Susu. The evening is hosted and moderated by Rachael Moore.

Collectif Susu is an afrofeminist, anticapitalist, anti-racist collective based in Brussels. Their creation is based on the fact that Black people face multiple and varied oppressions, in different spaces and by different authorities… Their main objective being to organize politically to fight together against these oppressions, they work on the development of times of militant struggle, through the collective assumption of responsibility of the problems which the people belonging to their communities are confronted with. At the same time, they work to create places of politicization, organization and meeting allowing them to put into practice, to question, even to adapt the theoretical tools inherited from their freedom fighters elders.

Henriette Essami (she/her) is the spokeswoman of the Undocumented Women Cmmittee (Comité des Femmes Sans-Papiers) and a member of various organizations such as La Voix Des Sans-Papiers collective, VSP Amazones, La Coordination des Sans-Papiers and other afro-feminist groups. She is a writer, an activist, a multi-faceted artist, and a dedicated mother. Fighting for the recognition of the rights of undocumented people in Belgium, She organizes a political occupation in the heart of the capital. Henriette is part of a collective movement leading fights to assert the right of undocumented people to have clear criteria for the regularization process. By forming strategic alliances and gathering support, they were collectively able to secure housing for hundred of our stranded diaspora's siblings. But Henriette isn't only a militant: she also is a black woman at the intersection of multiple domination mechanisms, which gave her a specific angle to re-think how we should collectively organize around oppressions.

Aïda Yancy (she/her) is a Brussels based LGBTI+ and anti-racist activist and educator. With a Masters in History, a specialization in Gender Studies and a degree in teaching, Aïda focuses on taking an intersectional approach regarding social inequities, race, gender, and sexuality. She’s particularly interested in the ways in which the notions of multiculturalism, diversity, and inclusivity are misused and the damages this causes to people not only from minorities but also those who are perceived as such. In the last two years she has been focusing on the concept of safer spaces and accessibility for LGBTQI+ people perceived as having a migration background, culminating by the publication of a toolbox for general services. Her work call’s for a redefinition of such concepts centered on the perspectives of the very people they tend to ignore.
