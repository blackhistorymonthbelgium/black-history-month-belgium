Black history month has started and what is a better way to start this month with an AYO open mic. A night that will bring us together through poetry, spoken word, dance and music. This is a safe space where participants are encouraged to express themselves.

It is a platform for first-time, established, and emerging: singers, poets, dancers, comedians, visual artists, writers (fiction and non-fiction), improv, Hip Hop, puppeteers, whatever one wants to showcase in front of a live audience!

If you would like to perform then please make sure to register via our link in our bio
