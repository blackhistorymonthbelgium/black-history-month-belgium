Music adds vibrancy to communities, strengthens the sense of belonging and connection while boosting overall emotional health in this light singer Lady Blaxx (Ra√Øssa Peeters) is organizing the Lady Blaxx Invites music event for a second time in collaboration with Black History Month Gent and our partner Voo?uit. With this new project, Lady Blaxx wants to break the stereotypes surrounding black artists engaging with their work as there is still very little representation on Belgian stages - certainly within 'non-black' genres. Time for this to change. Lady Blaxx invites emerging black artists to a live set at the Voo?uit so come join us in a night of celebration of black Belgian artists and be prepared to experience a live show you are likely not going to forget.
