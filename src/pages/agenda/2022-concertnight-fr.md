▝▝ ▘Brussels’ most promising talents in one place!
▝▝ ▘Discover the full BHM x AB programme here.
Black History Month Belgium (BHM) and AB join forces and celebrate the resilience of the black community again for a month this year. On Friday 4 March we present the cream of the new talent from Brussels. Four promising musicians, each with their own individual style, welcome you into their universes.
▝▝ ▘LINE-UP
The multidisciplinary artist Reinel Bakole leaves no one unmoved. She creates her own universe: instinctive and avant-garde. The matter of her identity as a woman of African origin is at the heart of her compositions and speaks of her strong connection with Africa and her Congolese roots. She blends jazz and afro-soul with poetic, almost lyrical vocals.
The singer from Brussels has not stood still over the past few years. In 2020, she shuttled back and forth between London and Brussels to work on her EP ‘AGØTM - a Gal On The Moon’. This was followed last year by her EP ‘Closer To Truth’. Since then she has travelled to Congo to work on her next EP.
Musician, actor and performer Dushime has a beautiful, dreamy voice that fits perfectly with her subtle, jazz-influenced beats. Her music has a healing, connecting power. Her first single ‘Common Point’, produced by Pippin (Noannaos), sounds promising, and she makes a deep impression live.
Mahina, from Brussels, won a lot of hearts in the last year. Her singles ‘Harmony’ and ‘Voix Cassée’, demonstrate an idiosyncratic musical style that combines R&B with dancehall influences. The artistic chameleon, as she calls herself, is an actor and painter as well as singer and musician. All of these passions inspire her to write music.
Last month, the Congolese-Brussels artist signed with the pioneering Ugandan Nyege Nyege label, where she has prepared the release of her EP ‘R.M.C (Reclaiming My Crown)’.
M I M I, aka DJ and artist Maria Green, lives in Brussels, was born in Lusaka (Zambia) and has roots in both Zambia and Angola. After moving to Belgium in 1998 at the age of four, she began exploring her Afro-European heritage. You can hear this in her Afrofuturist sets consisting of jungle, UK bass and garage. She has been Martha Da'Ro’s tour DJ, played at the Boiler Room Festival in Barcelona and is on the wishlist for the Nyege Nyege Festival (Uganda).
