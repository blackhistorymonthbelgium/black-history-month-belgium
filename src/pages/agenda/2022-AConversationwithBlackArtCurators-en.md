Kenny Mala Ngombe

Born in Leuven, Belgium, Kenny Mala Ngombe is a self-taught visual artist and curator with Congolese roots, creating characters  and scenes based on not only his surroundings but also results of a flow of imagination. As an artist, he has mostly been working with black markers, acrylic paint and oil bars, but has recently been developing himself within other media such as video and sculptures. As the curator for Customs & Borders, with its first event "Frontier of Contact" in september 2021, his goal is to curate and create projects with artists of African descent with representation being one of the main factors. He researches how abstract the role as a curator and/or institution can be in the process of an exhibition or residency. Currently developing a next project within Customs & Borders, called "Sounds in the Margins".

Rose-Myrtha Fortuna

The name Rose-Myrtha is a conjunction of the words Rosacae and Myrthacae. Both the Rosacae and Myrthacae are the names of plant families consisting of herbs, shrubs, and trees, with powerful healing qualities, but more so they are known for their beauty. The collision of these two words conjured the essence, the soul and the spirit of Rose-Myrtha. A powerful being with healing qualities, passionate by aesthetic pleasure. A passion which she transfigures in her work as an art curator, healer and plantwoman. At 18 years old she founded her own non-profit organization 'Kuchukua Hatua vzw'. With Kuchukua Hatua vzw she aims to generate, boost and bundle inner strengths to transform them into sustainable development within our societies. With Kuchukua Hatua she has organized and curated the ‘African contemporary art exhibitioin’ in 2016. The ‘Sankofa’ art exhibition in 2017. The ‘Healing through art‘ exhibition in 2019 and the ‘Honor&Respect – the de-objectification of Black femininity’ art exhibition in 2021. In Kuchukua Hatua latest expo Rose-Myrtha debuted as a visual artist for the very first time.
