Rainbow Nation Brussels, together with director and photographer Nneka V., created a portrait of 4 Black men and non-binary people (Nick-Arnaud, Andy, Bryan and Rodrigue) who have different experiences in the gay (and Black) communities in Brussels. The short film was made, upon commission by Black & Gay, Back in the Day's Marc Thompson, as the official Brussels contribution to the 2020 Global Back Pride, which took place online on July 10th 2020.
