Come and join us for the celebration of the official closing of Brussels activities of Black History Month Belgium 2022 – #BHMAssembly. Be there for the epic closer of a month full of more than 30 events in the capital city alone.

Celebrating ourselves is a political act and important to release our pain. Come vibe with others in a safe(r) and proud space and take a moment to enjoy and interact with music and dance performances that inspire us to heal and be joyful, food that nourishes our souls, and the dancefloor of an afterparty which glorifies Blackness in its entirety.

FREE ADMISSION

Dress code: as always, dress like you love yourself.

𝗜𝗠𝗣𝗢𝗥𝗧𝗔𝗡𝗧: the space is limited, therefore people have to be mindful that BHM Belgium is a celebration of Blackness and Black communities, and who they might be taking a spot from by choosing to come occupy this space.
