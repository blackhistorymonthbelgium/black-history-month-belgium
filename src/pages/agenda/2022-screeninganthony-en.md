Da Yie - Anthony Nti, 2020, 20’ (in English, French & Asante Twi with English subtitles)
Young Matilda and Prince are taken on a life-changing trip by a stranger. Da Yie (also known by its English title Good Night) portrays kids, gangsters and Ghana's vibrant coast as you've never seen them.

Mugabo - Amelia Umuhire, 2017, 6’31’’ (in Kinyarwanda with English subtitles)
Mugabo is a short experimental film about a young girl's return to the idealized homeland, a place full of borrowed memories.

Listen To The Beat Of Our Images - Audrey Jean-Baptiste & Maxime Jean-Baptiste, 2021, 15’ (in French with English subtitles)
Sixty years ago, the French government decided to establish its space center in Kourou (French Guiana, South America). 600 guyanese people were expropriated to allow France to realize its dream of space conquest. Combining field investigation and video-editing processes on archives, ‘Listen To the Beat of Our Images’ gives a voice to an invisibilized and silenced population.
