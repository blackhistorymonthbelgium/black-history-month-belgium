Do you also think back with such warmth to the games you played while growing up? Do you remember the bonding with fellow players and the joy after victory?
Then we have good news for you, because AYO is organizing an African Game Night together with De Roma. This night is part of Black History Month with the theme "The Power of Assembly”.
But it doesn't stop there. You also get the chance to help decide who can say once and for all that he is the master at making Jollof! Is it Ghana or Nigeria? But let's not forget Senegal, who claims to be the original Jollof maker? Or is Sierra Leone sneaking in to win the prize? They sometimes say that a person who eats alone cannot discuss the taste of the food with others.
And if that wasn't enough, there is also a mini afromarket. Various entrepreneurs displaying and selling their products, creations,....
