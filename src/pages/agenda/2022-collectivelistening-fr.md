Come and enjoy a 4 o’clock snack (vieruurtje/quatre-heures) while listening together to Amelia Umuhire’s visual sound piece Innocent (2020), followed by a conversation and Q&A with Amelia.

In Innocent (2020), Amelia Umuhire tells the story of Innocent Seminega – her father – as a young student, teacher, husband and parent up until his death at the hands of Hutu extremists in Rwanda in 1994. Tracing her family history as she addresses him, she weaves together threads from his love of linguistics, his romance with her mother, parenthood, and life lived amidst violent conflict – until unfurling her own story of her childhood and movement between countries – critiquing the white gaze which might try and frame her family’s story.

Innocent (2020) is an intimate portrait that resists the narrative canon that the West imposes on recent Rwandan history.

Black History Month Belgium extends a special invitation to people of Rwandan descent for this event.
