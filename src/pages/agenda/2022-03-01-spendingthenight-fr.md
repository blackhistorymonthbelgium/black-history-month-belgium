Black History Month Belgium invites you to a night at Decoratelier under the sign of the rhythmic connections between Afro-diasporic populations and the continent. Concerts by young Black(-descendant) Belgian musicians who put influences from the continent into their music, followed by an after-party by the Parisian Afro-diasporic collective Trap'Africa.
