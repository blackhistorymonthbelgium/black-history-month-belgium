The project local reporters is a collaboration between BHM Belgium, high school Sint-Willebrord – Heilige Familie (WILFAM) and the district of Berchem. Students from the 11th grade researched the assembly of black people in their neighborhood or community. The goal of this was to have the students take on the role of local reporters. They had to interview black organizations that reflect the way black people assemble in Antwerp. Stampmedia gave the students, through workshops, an introduction in media skills. On March 31 you can see the result of their labor in a mini-expo at their school. To realize this mini-expo, the students got help from curator Jaspe Azabe Habarurema



It is in this school that BHM has its own wall. The work of black artists will be displayed on this wall. This year we get to reveal the work of a second artist: Kool Koor.

Location: Ferdinand Coosemansstraat 17, 2600 Berchem

Partner: WILFAM
