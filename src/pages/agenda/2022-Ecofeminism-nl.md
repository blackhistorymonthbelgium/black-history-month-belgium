Malcom Ferdinand and Philsan Osman to present their respective books A Decolonial Ecology: Thinking from the Caribbean World (2022) and Voor Wie Willen We Zorgen? Ecofeminisme Als Inspiratiebron (2021), and then have an open conversation with activist and artist Ruth-Grâce Paluku-Atoka about the urgency to deconstruct our current approach to climate change and ecological justice, and to move towards an intersectionally feminist and decolonial approach to ecology.

The conversation will be followed by the screening (EN, 46 minutes) of salt:dispersed, the film adaptation of salt., Selina Thompson’s award-winning performance about grief, Black identity and colonialism

Synopsis: In February 2016, two artists got on a cargo ship, and retraced one of the routes of the Transatlantic Slave Triangle – from the UK to Ghana to Jamaica, and back. Their memories, their questions and their grief took them along the bottom of the Atlantic and through the figurative realm of an imaginary past. It was a long journey backwards, in order to go forwards. This show is what they brought back.
