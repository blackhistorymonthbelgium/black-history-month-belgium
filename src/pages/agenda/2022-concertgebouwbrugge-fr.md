Interrogating Through Photos, the Role Race Plays In driving the Black Community out of Bruges

In 2022, our focus will be on ‘the power of assembly.’ Documenting the different ways Black people in Belgium have gathered together throughout the years and acted in concert to raise awareness, call into question and explore new ways of thinking, acting, being, creating, exploring and caring. Coming together for friendship, worship, play, sports, learning, commerce, protest, governing, mourning, healing, or celebration is fundamental. In partnership with Concert Gebouw, Black History Month Bruges is inviting you to a month long exhibition. In this spirit, Concert Gebouw and Black History Month are pleased to present a selection of photographs depicting members of the Black community in Bruges. This community is not a monolith and consists of diverse ethnical backgrounds. From Senegal to Congo to Brurundi, to Ghana , … and back to Bruges. The artist collaborates with this mixed community to create images that reflect their experiences growing up, yet leaving Bruges, placing the role that race plays in this phenomenon, central.
 Come be in communion with us and share your own experiences of assembly via stories, photos, and/or mementos.
