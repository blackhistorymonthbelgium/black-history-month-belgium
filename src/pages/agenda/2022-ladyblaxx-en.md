EN: 2020. The year Amunaso stepped on a stage to sing in public for the first time and finally decided to pursue her musical dreams. Amunaso describes herself and her music as multidimensional, narrative and honest. Although she prefers not to pigeonhole her dreamy sound, she is strongly influenced by RnB, (neo)Soul and various styles within the Hip-Hop genre. With roots in Congo, but born and raised in the Netherlands and settled in Belgium, Amunaso wants to literally and artistically cross borders with her voice. She tries to show all facets of her personality in her lyrics, music and visuals. She has chosen to be called by her middle name, Amunaso, to pay tribute to her late grandmother after whom she is named.

EN: Jueles is a 19-year-old singer-songwriter born in Brussels. Growing up, she had a hard time expressing emotions and being herself. But when it came to singing or writing, the words just kept coming. After a long time of being misunderstood, Jueles finally found her language. The language of art, the language of freedom. With her single 'Bedroom', Jueles proves that she knows her history. In her music, which she also co-produced, you recognise her idols Prince, Destiny's Child and Justin Timberlake. Seductive R&B for the evening.

EN: Majé (23, real name Elvira Lawson) is a Belgian singer-songwriter and pianist with Togolese roots. She was born and raised in Roeselare, West Flanders, but both her parents are from Togo. Music fascinated her from an early age and became the thread running through her life. At the age of ten, Majé started piano lessons.  Three years later, after writing her first song, she became increasingly aware of her passion for singing and writing music. At the moment, she is also studying law at the KU Leuven. The stage name Majé comes from the Togolese word madjé, which means graceful. Through Majé, Elvira can express the emotions and thoughts she cannot express in daily life. This ambivalence can be heard in her first album, which she is currently working on. On 23 April 2021, Majé launched her debut single Loud & Proud, setting the tone for what we can expect from her. Majé's music can be categorised as pop, R&B and soul. Her musical influences include Anthony Hamilton, Lianne La Havas, D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Ms. Lauryn Hill, Angie Stone, Jill Scott, Floetry, Amy Winehouse and Anderson .Paak, but also local and international Belgian artists such as Zap Mama, Coely, Miss Angel, K.ZIA, Calya J., BEEZNEEZ and Ndugu rightfully deserve a place in that list.

EN: Calya J, also known as Jessica Boyeleba Balehen, is a 20-year-old and an Antwerp-based music artist. She writes/produces her own music and also plays a number of instruments. She is also the lead and backing vocalist of two bands: The Antwerp All Star Band and Phronexix. Since childhood, Jessica has been fascinated by music, not only by its sounds but especially by the different feelings it could evoke. At the music academy in Ekeren, she learned to develop her musical talent. She finished the last two years of her high school career at the Kunsthumaniora van Antwerpen. Early 2020, she made the conscious choice to go her own way in the music business and on June 21, she released her first EP called 'Blueprint'. She wrote, produced and released this EP herself under her stage name 'Calya J.'. The EP contains a mix of mystical beats/soundscapes and soul/rap vocals.

Blueprint' is literally a sketch of what this young lady has in store. Her talent was especially recognised at the Summer Jams of Mama's open mic. From then on, for her solo career, the ball started rolling and she was part of a number of projects such as: Bosbubbels and Sing Your Song, etc.
