In 2022, our focus will be on ‘the power of assembly.’ Documenting the different ways Black people in Belgium have gathered together throughout the years and acted in concert to raise awareness, call into question and explore new ways of thinking, acting, being, creating, exploring and caring. Coming together for friendship, worship, play, sports, learning, commerce, protest, governing, mourning, healing, or celebration is fundamental. In partnership with Kunsthal Gent, Black History Month Gent is inviting you to a two week

exhibition on the power of assembly curated in collaboration with you, our community. Come be in communion with us and share your own experiences of assembly via stories, photos, and/or mementos.
