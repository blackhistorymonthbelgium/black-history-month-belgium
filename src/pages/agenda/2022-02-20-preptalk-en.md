Partner(s): Voem, De Koer and Veggie = Halaal

Food has the power to create memories, the intimacy of cooking forges a connection between the cook, the people being fed and the rituals we participate in while preparing meals. It’s no wonder the kitchen is considered the hub of the home as it is where we fuel the hearts, minds bodies and souls of our families and friends. In the spirit of the theme – the power of assembly – Black History Month Gent and our partners at Voem, De Koer and Veggie = Halaal would like to invite you to a cooking workshop where 4 cooks help you create different cuisines that will the be shared with the whole group once the preparations are done.
