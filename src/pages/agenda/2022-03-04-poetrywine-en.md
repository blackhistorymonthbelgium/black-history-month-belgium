Karibu wouldn’t be Karibu without our staple event… our signature Poetry & Wine.

An evening known to bring us together through poetry, prose, spoken word, song, and music.

An evening where you can share your favorite poem/(short)story.

An evening where you can express your personality, life path, insights, and views.

So have you written a beautiful poem/ short story that you want to share with everyone, or do you have a favorite poet that you feel like the whole world should know and love as much as you do? Come and share it, but you’re also free to come and listen, booze it up and enjoy a cozy evening.

This year, in honor of BHM, we have a special evening planned….

Not only will you be able to listen to beautiful poetry recited by your peers, but the night will also be accompanied by a LIVE BAND.

A band ready to play all your requests, accompany your poems, your songs and make the evening a whole lot more special!

So share your talents, share the love, share this special night with BHM, Karibu and all your loved ones!
