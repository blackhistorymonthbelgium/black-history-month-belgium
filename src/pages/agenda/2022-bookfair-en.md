For its fifth anniversary, Black History Month Belgium will organize a Book Fair filled with fresh literary conversations and stories centering Black literature and oral traditions.

This Book Fair will be a unique opportunity to dive into the expansive and diverse world of Black(-descendant) storytellers and actors of the Belgian literature sector who are still too often underrepresented.

We will also welcome authors from our neighboring countries who share a language link with our multilingual Brussels context, namely the Netherlands, France and the UK.
