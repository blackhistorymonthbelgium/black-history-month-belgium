Kenny Mala Ngombe

Born in Leuven, Belgium, Kenny Mala Ngombe is a self-taught visual artist and curator with Congolese roots, creating characters  and scenes based on not only his surroundings but also results of a flow of imagination. As an artist, he has mostly been working with black markers, acrylic paint and oil bars, but has recently been developing himself within other media such as video and sculptures. As the curator for Customs & Borders, with its first event "Frontier of Contact" in september 2021, his goal is to curate and create projects with artists of African descent with representation being one of the main factors. He researches how abstract the role as a curator and/or institution can be in the process of an exhibition or residency. Currently developing a next project within Customs & Borders, called "Sounds in the Margins".

Marie Gomis-Trezise

Whether nurturing new musicians or launching the career of a promising visual artist, Marie Gomis-Trezise is best described as a serial scout of the best and brightest talent around. The groundbreaking creative director first made waves in the music industry as France’s first Black A&R in a major company. In developing her artists’ sound and image she fell in love with photography – that was the acorn from which GALERIE NUMBER 8 grew. Bringing together a new wave of photographers, predominantly from the African diaspora and global south, GALERIE NUMBER 8 champions artists with an unflinching gaze – those creatives whose work seeks to dismantle cultural barriers and sexual constructs. Since its launch in 2016, the gallery’s impact on popular culture has been immeasurable. It was one of the first space to exhibit the now-acclaimed photographer Campbell Addy, Justin French’s work with Ib Kamara and she has represented highly sought after names including David Uzochukwu, Djeneba Aduayom and Mous Lamrabat. The Brussels-based online gallery has also made a name for itself presenting innovative exhibitions across the globe, with shows at AKAA art fair, Unseen, Les Rencontres D’Arles, Dak’art Off Biennale and 1-54 London to mention just a few. Marie’s impact can be felt further afield through her creative directorship at Nataal, the global media brand spotlighting contemporary African fashion, music art and culture.
