The rich and growing body of black feminist writings of the last decades constitutes a powerful reminder of the fact that Black women have long worked to challenge and dismantle the many axes of oppression such as race, gender, class and ableism. Despite being widely excluded from mainstream feminism, history shows us that Black women have successfully harnessed the power of their nuanced experiences and knowledge to advocate for womenâ€™s rights.

Black feminism moves the voices and experiences Black women from the margins to the center of gender equality movements. In doing so, it engages with the multifaceted aspect of identity and gives way to the emergence of new forms of critical thinking, solidarity as well as solutions to fight systemic oppression.

Building on the mapping research work of Graciela Dutrieue, Black History Month Belgium will be holding an Open Forum to discuss and reflect on the past, present and future of Black feminist thought but also further exchange on the issues which continue to affect Black(-descendant) Women and non-binary People in Belgium.
