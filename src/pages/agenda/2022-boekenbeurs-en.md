As part of the fifth edition of Black History Month (BHM) Belgium, this year we will organize a bookfair in Antwerp (11-13 March 2022) focusing on black literature and oral traditions. The aim of this project is to bring together people from the black community to immerse themselves in the literature and spoken word created by black authors. With this three-day bookfair filled with storytellers, podcast makers, poets, authors, publishers, and more, we will create a space for our target audiences to discover and share their own (black) voice. In addition, workshops will be organized during which guests can learn how to develop their own literary creations and products. Interesting panels will be organized on relevant topics. This book fair will ultimately contribute to the building of an archive of black literary culture which is blossoming in Belgium. All are welcome – we look forward to seeing you there!
