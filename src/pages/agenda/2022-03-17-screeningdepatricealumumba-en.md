Black History Month Belgium and Afrika FilmFestival Leuven invite you to a special screening of From Patrice to Lumumba (2019), an independent documentary written by Patrick Kabeya, which chronicles the story of Patrice Lumumba, the first prime minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo and one of the faces associated with the country's liberation after Belgian colonization.

'From Patrice to Lumumba' focuses on Lumumba's last letter to his wife Pauline, which he decided to write to her as his fate was decided, as a token of the promise he had made to himself about his country and his people. This letter, although keeping a militant tone, reveals the more private side of Lumumba, yet freer still to express what is deep inside him. This story, mainly told in his own words, gives Lumumba back the humanity he was not afforded throughout his career. It is about understanding the passion that animated his convictions. But above all, it is about seeing the man behind the political emblem, facing a destiny that gradually escapes him.

Duration of the film: 70 min

Language: FR (with EN and NL subtitles)
