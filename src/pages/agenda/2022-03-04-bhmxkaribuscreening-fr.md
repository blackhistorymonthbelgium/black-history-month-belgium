Karibu Leuven, Black History Month Belgium, and Afrika Filmfestival present the 2017 documentary ‘This is Congo’.

Here’s why:

To correctly interpret the present, we must ensure a thorough understanding of the past. Throughout secondary education, our history classes solely focused on key events in Western/European history, but what about Africa? Which historical events, key to our understanding of current African affairs, have we never been taught about in school? And could these events have influenced our perception of each other as Belgians of African descent?

To answer some of these questions, we shine a light on the infamous yet neglected conflict in the East of DRCongo. Originating from the ‘Second Congo war’, with involvement of up to 9 African countries and 25 armed groups, it is no wonder the historical event is nicknamed ‘the African World War’. Although the conflict formally came to an end in 2002, violence has continued, and war prevails in the area to this day. Besides its ongoing legacy of devastation in the DRCongo, the conflict birthed lasting relational issues between Belgians of Congolese and Rwandan descent. More so, these groups often hold grudges against each other, often with only limited knowledge on the events that cause their distrust. In line with this years BHM theme ‘Assembly’, our event attempts to bring Belgians of African descent closer together, to learn about our history, heal possible wounds, and assemble in the truest sense of the word.

The screening of ‘This Is Congo’ will be preceded by an introduction to the conflict by Marie Bamutese, Political Scientist and co-author of the book ‘Marie, leven met de dood’. In her book, she talks about her experience in the Rwandan genocide of 1994, and its aftermath in the Second Congo War. She will give a short overview of the war and its dynamics and bring into context the relational issues between Belgians of Congolese and Rwandan descent that stem from it. This way, everyone attending the event will have some prior knowledge to the documentary’s topic and its context.
